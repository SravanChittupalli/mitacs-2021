Had a short meet with the professor. We discussed about the project in detail. I was then given 3 videos and the task is to segregate ripe, unripe strawberries and flowers and also find the level of ripeness(unripe, partially ripe, almost ripe, fully ripe) of the strawberries. Before starting with the task I had to research a bit and submit my plan of action. I will start coding from tomorrow.

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
